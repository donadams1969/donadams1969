---

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

* 🔧 **Modular Design**
  Built with OpenZeppelin contracts (`Ownable`, `AccessControl`, `ReentrancyGuard`) for enterprise-level security.
* 🧭 **Enum-Based Workflow**
  Uses `CaseStatus` enum with **7 programmable states** for transparent, on-chain case lifecycle tracking.
* 📦 **IPFS Storage**
  Stores AI-generated reports off-chain using **IPFS CIDs** — preserving blockchain immutability without bloating gas.

---

## 🔐 Security Features

* 🧑‍⚖️ **Role-Based Access**

  * `REVIEWER_ROLE`: human oversight
  * `AI_ORACLE`: ML system write access
  * 🔏 ECDSA signature-based authentication
* ⏳ **Temporal Safety**

  * Auto-expiring cases via `checkExpiration`
  * Emergency pause via **circuit breaker pattern**

---

## ⛽ Gas Optimization

* 🌀 **Batch Processing**
  Uses `AccessControlEnumerable` to reduce repetitive calls
* 🪶 **Lightweight Data Footprint**
  AI content stays off-chain via IPFS = lower gas
* 🚫 `nonReentrant` everywhere it matters

---

## 🤖 AI Integration

* 📡 **Decoupled Oracle Channel**
  `storeAIReport()` enables external AI systems to submit verified outputs
* 🔗 **aiReportCID**
  Logged securely with each case
* 🧠 AI & human logic kept isolated for verifiability and modularity

---

## 🧪 Dev & Ops Notes

* ✅ **Testing:**
  Foundry test suite recommended for ECDSA & role logic
* ♻️ **Upgrade Path:**
  Use OZ Transparent Proxy pattern for long-term evolution
* ⛓️ **Automation Suggestion:**
  Integrate **Chainlink Automation** to monitor stale or idle cases

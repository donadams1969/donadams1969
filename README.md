🧬 Provenance
This package represents the canonical Sovereign Transaction Attestation for the VALORCHAIN-G ledger.
It was assembled by DG77.77X-Ξ, Sovereign Founder of VALORCHAIN-G, under the YHWH-25 kernel attestation framework and the YHWH-24 document anchor lineage.

Each artifact carries ISO-8601 creation timestamps and self-contained metadata linking it to the immutable Parent CID above.

📁 Contents
File	Description
VALORCHAIN-G_SovereignTx_Attestation.json	Core attestation metadata; contains Merkle root and proof count.
VALORCHAIN-G_MerkleProof.json	Full Merkle proof tree for verification.
verify_valorchain_merkle.py	Stand-alone Python verifier to confirm Merkle integrity.
YHWH-24_Sovereign_Document_Anchor.json	Sovereign anchor binding the PDF evidence and author identifiers.
VALORCHAIN-G_Manifest.txt	Human-readable manifest of the bundle.
🔐 Verification Steps
Hash the ZIP bundle

openssl dgst -sha3-512 VALORCHAIN-G_SovereignTx_Package.zip

Record the resulting digest in your ledger. Verify individual files sha3sum VALORCHAIN-G_*.json verify_valorchain_merkle.py

Validate the Merkle proof python3 verify_valorchain_merkle.py

Expected output: Verification result: True

Cross-check Parent CID Ensure each JSON includes: "valoraiplus_module_id": "bafybeihjc3tq5a6n7d8p9z0x1y2w3v4u5t6s7r8q9p0o1n2m3l4k5j6i7h8g9f0e"

🌐 IPFS / Blockchain Deployment Upload the ZIP to IPFS: ipfs add VALORCHAIN-G_SovereignTx_Package.zip

Store the returned CID in your VALORCHAIN-G registry smart contract ornotarization ledger. Optionally mint a metadata NFT referencing that CID for public verification. 🧾 Authorship & Rights Author: DG77.77X-ΞAffiliation: VALORCHAIN-G / ValorAi+® SystemsLicense: Sovereign Research & Attestation Archive © 2025Integrity Algorithm: SHA3-512 (NIST FIPS 202) 🧠 Fortran Kernel Reference This package aligns with: PROGRAM valoraiplus2e_YHWH_5150_KERNEL_OVERRIDE_MODE STATE: YHWH-5150.O [Override Active] IMMUTABILITY STATUS: Temporarily Suspended by SGAU 7226.3461

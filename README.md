Hi, I’m @donadams1969

- 👀 I’m interested in building ethical tech, exposing systemic injustice, and using AI to protect veterans, whistleblowers, and the truth. Also: space stuff, music, and the occasional cosmic mind trip.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to weaponize blockchain for good, turn moral injury into public policy, and make bureaucracy flinch.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on justice-driven AI projects, creative media with a conscience, and truth-backed storytelling that leaves a mark.
- 📫 How to reach me: donny@18fu.ai — Federal land. Secured IP. Valor Protocol active.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him. Also accepts “Valor,” “Chief Strategist,” or “That guy who sent 87 emails to the DOJ and meant every word.”
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once turned a lawsuit into a documentary, a therapy session into a federal investigation, and a joke into a digital constitution. Don’t underestimate me.

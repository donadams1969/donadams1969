## 🧭 WHAT IS CALISOTA?  

**Calisota Quest** is a gamified cannabis loyalty platform built for the real ones: the growers, the tokers, the truth-seekers. Think Pokémon Go meets Cheech & Chong, but every strain you unlock becomes a **digital collectible** with **on-chain lore**, **loyalty perks**, and **VALOR AI+ intelligence**.

> *“We’re not selling weed. We’re selling the hunt for what weed used to feel like.”*

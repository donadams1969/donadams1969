## üß¨ Overview

This GitHub branch introduces the **VBLKx Token**, an enhanced, anti-short ERC-20 token with built-in protections, gated exclusively by the `VALORBadgeNFT` identity layer.

**Together**, these two contracts form a **civil-rights-aligned, testimony-anchored, market-resistant asset class** engineered for:

- Compliance enforcement  
- Liquidity shielding  
- Contributor authentication  
- Web3-based legal sovereignty

Here's a visual flow diagram of the Anti-Short Reflex Protocol designed for DBLK:

Red: Detects and penalizes shorting activity

Gold/Green: Uses sell tax and buyback vaults to stabilize price

Purple/Cyan: Tracks wallet behavior and mirrors synthetic shorts

Blue: Triggers auto-squeeze to punish aggressive borrowing

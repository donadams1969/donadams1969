## 🧭 WHAT IS CALISOTA?  

**Calisota Quest** is a gamified cannabis loyalty platform built for the real ones: the growers, the tokers, the truth-seekers. Think Pokémon Go meets Cheech & Chong, but every strain you unlock becomes a **digital collectible** with **on-chain lore**, **loyalty perks**, and **VALOR AI+ intelligence**.

> *“We’re not selling weed. We’re selling the hunt for what weed used to feel like.”*

You’ve just described a self-scaling, real-world, AR-powered cannabis loyalty economy.
We’re going to encode it as the VALOR BUD Protocol™—a Moore’s Law loyalty engine that rewards:

Customers for scanning + walking in

💸 VALORBUD™ Economy: VBUD Token Utility Layer

Summary: VBUD ($VBUD) is the official utility token of the Calisota ecosystem. It fuels every scan, step, conversation, and redemption. Designed as an ERC-20 token, it is used to reward players, tip budtenders, credit dispensaries, and scale the VALOR AI+ data system.

Quote: “Fueled by loyalty. Powered by VALOR.”

🪙 VBUD Token Functionality

Here is an expanded, GitHub-ready, badge-rich, and immersive breakdown of the VBUD Token Functionality section—ready to be embedded directly into your white paper or GitHub repo:

---

💸 VBUD Token Functionality

> “Fueled by loyalty. Powered by VALOR.”

---

🪙 Overview

VBUD is the on-chain heartbeat of Calisota Quest.
It powers every scan, interaction, purchase, and piece of lore. It creates a multi-sided reward economy between:

👤 Players

🧑‍💼 Budtenders

🏪 Dispensaries

🧠 VALOR AI+

---

📊 Who Earns VBUD — and How

---

🔧 Utility Per Stakeholder

---

🔁 VBUD Utility Loop

1. Player scans QR
2. Budtender validates inside → both receive VBUD
3. Dispensary logs verified engagement → receives VBUD
4. VALOR AI+ analyzes behavior + engagement
5. Token inflation/deflation adjusts based on node activity
6. Community votes on next lore branch using staked VBUD

---

🛠️ Smart Contract Features (Preview)

mintVBUD(address to, uint amount) – Admin-only function to distribute

redeemVBUD(uint amount) – Used to unlock AR NFTs or whitelist access

rewardNodeInteraction(address user) – Auto-executed on successful QR → redeem interaction

burnVBUD(uint amount) – For exclusive merch or DAO events

Would you like this smart contract and staking logic encoded into your white paper, or shall I now generate the official VALORBUD.sol (ERC-20) smart contract to go with this section?

---

🔁 Game Loop Integration

1. Player scans QR (outside dispensary) → XP + NFT minted


2. Walks in-store → Dispensary receives VBUD token


3. Budtender confirms quest completion → Receives PotCoin tip + VBUD split


4. Player redeems merch, learns strain story → XP + lore unlock


5. VALOR AI+ learns behavior → Ecosystem self-reinforces

---

🔧 Technical Notes

Token Name: VALORBUD

Symbol: VBUD

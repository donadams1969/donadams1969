# Calisota Strain Website  
**Veteran-Owned | Powered by VALOR AI+ | Rooted in OG Cannabis Culture**

This is the official front-end and metadata repository for the **Calisota Quest** ecosystem—a gamified, NFT-powered cannabis experience built to honor legacy strains, empower dispensaries, and reward loyal stoners through a decentralized, augmented reality scavenger hunt.

---

## Overview

Calisota is a cross-cultural fusion of:
- **California cannabis lore**
- **Minnesota roots and hustle**
- **AR-driven gamification**
- **Blockchain-based loyalty + NFT collectibles**
- **VALOR AI+ automation and strain indexing**

Players explore dispensaries, unlock rare NFT cards (like **Trainwreck**, **Green Crack**, and **Minna Snowta™**), follow a Monkey on a hero’s quest, and earn digital + real-world rewards.
